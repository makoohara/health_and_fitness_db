### Data Requirements for VitalVerve

**User Data:**
- **Details Captured:** VitalVerve will capture the user's full name, age, gender, height, weight, email address, and a profile picture. Additionally, users can input their fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance.
- **Personalized Experience:** This data will enable the app to provide personalized workout and nutrition recommendations. For instance, calorie needs and workout intensity can be tailored based on age, weight, and fitness goals.

**Workout Information:**
- **Data Points:** Apart from the type and duration of the workout, VitalVerve will track the user's heart rate, calories burned, and specific exercises performed with their respective repetitions and sets.
- **Wearable Integration:** VitalVerve will integrate with wearable devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit. This allows for real-time tracking of heart rate, steps taken, and even GPS tracking for outdoor activities like running or cycling.

**Nutrition Logs:**
- **Granularity:** The app will provide a detailed breakdown of each meal, including individual ingredients, portion sizes, and preparation methods.
- **Macronutrients and Micronutrients:** Both macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats) and essential micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) will be tracked.
- **Data Input:** Users can manually input their meals, scan barcodes of packaged foods, or search from an integrated nutrition database to quickly add food items.

**Sleep Patterns:**
- **Insights:** Beyond duration, VitalVerve will provide insights on sleep efficiency, disturbances, and times of sleep onset and waking.
- **Sleep Stages:** The app, especially when integrated with wearables, can differentiate between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM cycles, providing users with a detailed sleep graph.

**Other Health Metrics:**
- **Additional Metrics:** VitalVerve will also track mood through mood logs, hydration levels based on water intake, and menstrual cycles for female users.
- **Holistic View:** By tracking these metrics, users can understand patterns, such as how mood might be affected by sleep quality or how hydration impacts workout performance.

**Data Relationships:**
- **Interconnections:** Data elements are interconnected to provide holistic insights. For instance, poor sleep quality might be linked to higher calorie consumption the next day, or dehydration might correlate with decreased workout performance.

**Importance of Data:**
- **Significance:** Capturing comprehensive data points allows users to get a 360-degree view of their health, making it easier to pinpoint areas of improvement and celebrate successes.
- **Contribution to App's Goal:** Each data element, from sleep to nutrition, plays a pivotal role in ensuring users stay on track with their health and fitness goals.
- **Data Privacy and Security:** VitalVerve will employ end-to-end encryption to ensure user data remains private. Regular security audits and GDPR compliance will ensure users have control over their data and can trust the app with their information.
